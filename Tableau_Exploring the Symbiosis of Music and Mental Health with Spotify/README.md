# Summary 

## Introduction

Music, a universal language transcending borders and cultures, holds profound significance in our lives. It evokes emotions, ignites memories, and provides solace in distress. From ancient times to the digital age, music has been integral, serving as a conduit for expression and connection.

In today's digital landscape, Spotify has emerged as the epicenter of music consumption, catering to diverse tastes worldwide. With its vast library and personalized recommendations, Spotify revolutionizes music discovery. It possesses invaluable data insights into consumer behavior and trends, shaping the way we listen, discover, and share music. Beyond mere entertainment, music plays a pivotal role in shaping our mental well-being. Numerous studies have highlighted the therapeutic effects of music on our mental health, illustrating its ability to alleviate stress, boost mood, and foster emotional resilience. In an increasingly hectic world, the importance of mental health awareness and support cannot be overstated. Recognizing the profound impact of music on mental well-being, Spotify has spearheaded initiatives aimed at promoting mental health awareness and support. Through curated playlists, podcasts, and partnerships with mental health organizations, Spotify endeavors to harness the healing power of music to uplift and empower individuals facing mental health challenges.

The project navigates the harmonious intersection of music, data analysis and mental well-being to uncover the transformative potential of sound.

## Data description

The dataset comprises results exploring the data of the popular streaming platform Spotify, analyzing the relationship between music and mental health. It includes consumer trends from a diverse group of participants about their music listening habits, preferences, and the perceived impact of music on their mental health. Variables in the data could include demographic information (age, gender, location), types of music genres preferred, duration and frequency of music listening, and self-reported measures of mental well-being (such as mood, stress levels, and anxiety). The data also contain qualitative responses detailing personal experiences and reflections on how music affects the consumer's mental health, providing insights into the therapeutic potential of music.


## Working process

The project aimed to build a story visualization board, which explored the Symbiosis of Music and Mental Health with Spotify. It explored the harmony in evolution of music over time to understand its core purpose and how it has been used. People choose to listen to music for many reasons such as enjoyment, relaxation, to concentrate, to build energy for workouts and most importantly, to heal. We found that music and mental health are two sides of the same coin.

The focus was narrowed to the avenues with which music is accessible to people and is most popularly used. It was found that Spotify plays a key role in reaching and connecting millions of people with many kinds of music. Spotify has emerged as the leader of the music streaming industry, one which can be described as rebellious and disruptive. However, while Spotify’s success is an exciting story, we wanted to explore the nexus between music and mental health.

With this in mind, the realities of mental health was traced globally in the dashboard. The data identified anxiety and depression as key factors troubling the mind. The project delved deeper into the trends surrounding mental health issues such as lifetime anxiety and/or depression reports as well as indications of treatments. 

Finally, the impact of music in helping improve mental health was investigated, particularly reported cases of anxiety, depression, insomnia, and OCD. This helped us gain a better understanding of people’s behaviors and their dependency on music. 

## Conclusion

The project found that although people may rely on music for their own unique reasons, music does have a positive influence in their lives and helps them navigate the fine balance of mental health stability.
